# Personal NeoVim configuration

This is my personal NeoVim configuration to be used while coding to optimize my workflow. Feel free to copy and use some configurations if you want to.
There are some external dependencies if you would like to use my configuration on your system.

- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is used for the Telescope live grep function. Without Ripgrep this function is not usable.
- [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit#installation) is used for working with Git within Neovim.
